table=True tells SQLModel that this is a table model, it should represent a table in the SQL database, it's not just a data model (as would be any other regular Pydantic class).

Field(primary_key=True) tells SQLModel that the id is the primary key in the SQL database (you can learn more about SQL primary keys in the SQLModel docs).

By having the type as int | None, SQLModel will know that this column should be an INTEGER in the SQL database and that it should be NULLABLE.

Field(index=True) tells SQLModel that it should create a SQL index for this column, that would allow faster lookups in the database when reading data filtered by this column.

SQLModel will know that something declared as str will be a SQL column of type TEXT (or VARCHAR, depending on the database).

#sessions
A Session is what stores the objects in memory and keeps track of any changes needed in the data, then it uses the engine to communicate with the database.
